# Online-Retail-Database
This is an online e-commerce business created to showcase how to make a simple database using SQL

The company is called C.P. Prestige where it stands for ‘Chess Piece Prestige’. The company is a Canadian e-commerce business where it sells high end chess pieces, where each piece can be sold separately along with a chess board and certification slips for each order. The site will also sell a carrying case that stores each piece including the board, and the ultimate package will include everything that the company offers (all chess pieces for a single game, chess board, and carrying case along with certification slip). 

The SQL Code is in text format, but the formatting is all accurate to copy and paste it into a database and run the commands to see the tables and the charts that appear with answers to the questions.
